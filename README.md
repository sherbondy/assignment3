To run on Athena or Mac OS:

```
git submodule init && git submodule update
make
```

a3soln and libRK4.a have not been included since they were compiled exclusively for Linux.
If I manage to implement Runge-Kutta myself over the next few days, I'll make sure to include
it here as a static library. Otherwise, we'll have to play the waiting game.

Enjoy.
